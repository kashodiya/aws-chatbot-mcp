## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from aws_chatbot.conversation_tracker import get_conversation_tracker

# Get the global tracker
tracker = get_conversation_tracker()

# Start a conversation
conversation_id = tracker.start_conversation("List my EC2 instances")

# The agent automatically logs all events during processing
response = await agent.process_query("List my EC2 instances")

# Get conversation events
events = tracker.get_conversation_events(conversation_id)

# Export conversation
exported_data = tracker.export_conversation(conversation_id)
```

### Advanced Analysis

```python
# Get session summary
summary = tracker.get_session_summary()
print(f"Total events: {summary['total_events']}")
print(f"Event breakdown: {summary['event_counts']}")

# Filter events by type
llm_requests = [e for e in tracker.get_recent_events(100) 
                if e.event_type.value == 'llm_request']

# Analyze performance
durations = [e.duration_ms for e in tracker.get_recent_events(100) 
             if e.duration_ms is not None]
avg_duration = sum(durations) / len(durations) if durations else 0
```

## Configuration

### Enable Debug Logging
Update `mcp_agent.config.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  level: debug
  transports: [console, file]
  path: "logs/mcp-agent-detailed.jsonl"
```

### Tracking Settings
The conversation tracker can be configured with:

```python
tracker = DetailedConversationTracker(
    session_id="custom-session-id",
    max_events=2000  # Maximum events to keep in memory
)
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Events are kept in memory with configurable limits
- **Storage**: File-based logging available for persistence
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal overhead (~1-2ms per event)
- **Scalability**: Designed for single-session use; consider external storage for multi-session deployments

## Security and Privacy

- **Sensitive Data**: Be aware that all LLM interactions are logged
- **API Keys**: Ensure API keys are not logged in request/response data
- **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies
- **Access Control**: Secure the conversation viewer and API endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Events**: Ensure the tracker is initialized before agent operations
2. **Memory Usage**: Adjust `max_events` if memory usage is too high
3. **Performance**: Disable detailed tracking in production if performance is critical
4. **Export Errors**: Check that the session has events before exporting

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to see detailed tracking information:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Tree View**: Visual representation of event hierarchies
- **Real-time Streaming**: WebSocket-based live event streaming
- **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated event filtering options
- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed performance analysis and optimization suggestions
- **Integration**: Integration with external monitoring and analytics systems
- **Persistence**: Database-backed storage for long-term retention

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing event structure and naming conventions
2. Add appropriate metadata to new event types
3. Update the web interface for new event types
